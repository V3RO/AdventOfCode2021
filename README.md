# AdventOfCode
This repository contains my solution for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). ðŸŽ„<br>
The Problems are solved with C# (NET5). <br>
The solutions are probably often not solved optimally, because I usually implement my first idea instead of looking for the best/most optimal solution.

### Stopped after Day 12 due to lack of time.
